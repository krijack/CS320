Reflection
How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
To make sure my code is functional, I rely on thorough testing, including writing unit tests and using test automation tools. This helps me catch bugs early and confirm that each part of my program works as expected. For security, I follow best practices like validating user input, handling exceptions properly, and protecting sensitive data. I also try to stay updated on common security risks so I can avoid them in my code.

How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
I start by carefully reading through the requirements and, if possible, asking questions to clarify anything that’s unclear. I try to put myself in the user’s shoes to understand what they really need from the software. Then, I break down those needs into specific features or tasks and make sure my code addresses each one. I also use feedback from testing or users to make improvements.

How do I approach designing software?
When designing software, I like to plan things out before I start coding. I usually sketch out the main components and how they’ll interact, either on paper or using diagrams. I focus on making the design modular and easy to maintain, so it’s simpler to update or fix later. I also think about how I’ll test each part, which helps me write cleaner, more reliable code from the start.
